# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-CT-Scans
This project focuses on the development of a robust lung cancer detection system using machine learning. The methodology begins with the meticulous collection and pre-processing of a diverse and representative dataset of lung cancer images, obtained either from publicly available datasets or through collaboration with medical institutions. The pre-processing involves standardizing image resolutions, normalizing pixel values, and addressing missing data.

The dataset is strategically divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with 70% allocated for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Feature extraction is a pivotal step, involving the extraction of pertinent features from lung cancer images. Common techniques include utilizing pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors or crafting image features manually.

The project involves the selection of a suitable machine learning algorithm, with a particular emphasis on CNN architectures like ResNet, VGG, or Inception, adapted to the available data and computational resources. The selected model undergoes training with an appropriate optimization algorithm and loss function. Fine-tuning of hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, is performed using the validation set.

Model evaluation is conducted on the testing dataset, employing metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for unbiased performance assessment. In cases of unsatisfactory results, model optimization strategies are explored, including adjustments to architecture, data augmentation techniques, or expansion of the dataset. This comprehensive approach aims to develop an accurate and reliable lung cancer detection model with implications for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.
